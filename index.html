                <p>
                    It was in the year 2020. Humanity was at the brink of 
                    extinction by a new virus, COVID19. <br>
                    Almost every country was in lockdown.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Utter boredom struck me, leading to the manifestation of the ubiquitous genome in all of us:
                    <em>curiosity</em>. <br>
                    "Is playing games all I can use my laptop for?" <br> "My creative powers are dying, I
                    must
                    stir and awaken them." <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the back of my mind, arose a question: What is programming? <br>
                    Think of this as that moment Morpheus presented Neo with the pills.
                    You know the choice I made.
                    The journey began, and down the rabbit hole I went. <br>

            <!-- Intro -->
            <article id="intro">

                <h2 class="major">About</h2>

                <p>
                    As a hands-on software developer with 3 years of industry
                    experience, I specialize in building robust R and R Shiny
                    web applications. I am enthusiastic about collaborating with
                    customers to identify and deliver optimal solutions tailored
                    to their specific needs and budgets. By carefully customizing
                    each product, I ensure that users receive software assets
                    and reliably actionable code that align with their requirements.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My expertise lies in the R programming language, and I have
                    consistently developed products using it for the past three
                    years. From proficiently handling data wrangling to creating
                    interactive analysis and visualization through R Shiny, and
                    even generating comprehensive reports using Rmarkdown, I am
                    well-versed in the full spectrum of R's capabilities.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Additionally, I possess working experience with Python and
                    Django, and on the database side, I have proficiently worked
                    with PostgreSQL. Picking up new frameworks or languages is
                    never an issue for me, although my strongest area of focus
                    is backend development.

                <p>
                    Software Developer &mdash;
                    <a href="https://actserv.co.ke/">Actuarial Services (EA) Limited</a>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Implemented an actuarial valuation system for general
                        insurance using R and JavaScript. Employing the powerful
                        data.table library in R, the system achieved a significant
                        reduction in processing time. The generation of runoff
                        triangles, which previously took 1-2 hours using excel,
                        was optimized to complete in less than 5 seconds.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Built a web app using R to analyze and visualize the
                        performance of the various classes in Kenya's insurance
                        industry. Leveraging R's plotly library, I created
                        interactive visualizations that enabled users to explore
                        and understand the data more intuitively. I used
                        PostgreSQL to implement a robust backend solution
                        capable of handling concurrent transactions seamlessly.
                        The app significantly improved the efficiency of
                        coworkers by providing them with a user-friendly
                        interface to swiftly analyze the performance of
                        different organizations within the insurance sector.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Developed a system in R that automated the conversion of
                        xlsx files to csv, addressing the challenge of handling
                        large datasets split across multiple files. The
                        application efficiently optimized processing speed by
                        executing system calls through bash scripts. Its
                        user-friendly interface allowed coworkers to easily
                        customize column types and seamlessly merge multiple
                        related datasets into a single consolidated file.
                        The app's efficiency and flexibility made it a widely
                        adopted solution within the team.
