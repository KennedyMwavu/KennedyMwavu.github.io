## Hi! I'm Kennedy Mwavu.

### What I Do
I'm a `self-taught` developer specifically working as an R shiny developer.

I build production grade dashboards using [R Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) for data analysis and interactive data visualization. 
Most often the process involves communication between the application and a database:
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations

The good thing is that you can do all this from my dashboards, with zero database knowledge. So I do the heavylifting, you just have to worry about inputing the correct data.

### Tech-Stack
My **tech-stack** is as follows:
- R and R Shiny
- Python
- PostgreSQL
- LaTex

### Lately
Currently **learning** HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

### Website
Visit [mwavu.com](mwavu.com) to view my portfolio and some of the projects I've worked on. 

All the code for the projects is in my github repositories.
