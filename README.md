## Hi! I'm Kennedy Mwavu.

I'm a `self-taught` developer specifically working as an R shiny developer.

I build production grade dashboards using [R Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) for data analysis and interactive data visualization. 
Most often the process involves communication between the application and a database:
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations

The good thing is that you can do all this from my dashboards, with zero database knowledge. So I do the heavylifting, you just have to worry about inputing the correct data.

My **tech-stack** is as follows:
- R and R Shiny
- Python
- PostgreSQL
- LaTex

Currently **learning** HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

Feel free to visit [my website](mwavu.com) to view my portfolio and some of the projects I've worked on. All the code for the projects is in my github repositories.
